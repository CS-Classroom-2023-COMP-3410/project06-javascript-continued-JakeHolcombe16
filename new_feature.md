I attempted to add an ability to have fill the canvas.

It's reasonable because it doesn't require any backend or security requirements and isn't extremely complicated.


the fill area feature would add a the ability to to fill a closed brush area with a color.

After prompts it's simply breaks other features and the brush no longer works along with the features it implemented before it.
